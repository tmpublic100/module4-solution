  <h1>Module 4 Solution</h1>
  <p>To grade, you must open dev tools (Ctrl-Shift-I on Chrome) and look at the CONSOLE output.</p>

<p>Also, if you see a "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()" then just hit F5 to refresh.  There appears to be some lag in githib serving Pages.  I've seen this on many assignments posted sites from other students as well.</p>
  <h1>Thank you!</h1>
